The way the test harness works is as follows.  For each test case, there
are three files checked into the cvs repository:

 - foo.jl5: the test case itself
 - foo.jl5-expected: a file containing whatever error messages are output
by the compiler upon compiling foo.jl5
 - foo.java-expected: a file containing the java translation of foo.jl5 as
output by the compiler

To run the test suite, go to the testing directory and type
       make runtests
This will run all the tests and compare the outputs against the *-expected
files.  A message about success or failure will be output for each test
case.  The easiest thing to do is to pipe it to a file and inspect the
file after all tests have run.

To add new test cases to the repository, add some .jl5 files to the
testing directory.  When you're sure that your version of the compiler is
correct, run
       make expected
to regenerate all the *-expected files for all the .jl5 files.
